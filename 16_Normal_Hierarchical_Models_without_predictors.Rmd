# (Normal) Hierarchical Models without Predictors

```{r lodainglib, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bayesrules)

```


**Learning objectives:**

- *Build* a hierarchical model of variabl $Y$ with no predictors $X$  
- *Simulate* and analyze this hierarchical model with **rstanarm**  
- Utilize hierarchical models for predicting $Y$

## Data Set!

```{r LoadingData}
data(spotify, package = "bayesrules")
```


We are going to use a subset Spotify data set from #TidyTuesday: 

- 44 artists
  -> 350 songs


```{r}
spotify <- spotify |> 
  select(artist, title, popularity) |> 
  mutate(artist = fct_reorder(artist, popularity, .fun = 'mean'))
```

```{r}
table(spotify$artist) |> hist(xlab = "Songs/artist", col = 4)
```

We are going to illustrate the 3 approaches seen in chapter 15: 

* Complete pooling  
* No pooling
* Partial pooling


Btw my top 3 most listening song/group from last week are: 

- Dina Summer - Passion (cover)
- The Do - Anita No
- Purrrple cat - stream 


## Complete pooled model

Notations:

$j$ will indicate *artist*, $j \in {1, 2 ..., 44}$

$i$ will indicate *song* for artist $j$

$n_j$ Number of song we have for artist $j$

Example: Mia X, the first artist in our data set, has 4 songs -> $n_1 = 4$ 


```{r}
ggplot(spotify, aes(x = popularity)) + 
  geom_density()
```

Even if the distribution is left skewed we will go with a **Normal-Normal complete pooled model** 

$$Y_{ij}|\mu,\sigma \sim N (\mu, \sigma²)$$

$$\mu \sim N(50, 52^2)$$

$$\sigma  \sim Exp(0.048)$$

$\mu$ and $\sigma$ are **global parameter**: they do not vary by artist: 

- $\mu$: global mean popularity

- $\sigma$ : global standard deviation in popularity from song to song


```{r, results='hide'}
spotify_complete_pooled <- stan_glm(
  popularity ~ 1,  # trick is here \mu = beta_0 (intercept) with no X
  data = spotify, family = gaussian, 
  prior_intercept = normal(50, 2.5, # I do not understand 2.5
                           autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735)
```


```{r}
complete_summary <- tidy(spotify_complete_pooled, 
                         effects = c("fixed", "aux"), 
                         conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.80)
complete_summary
```

### Quiz!!

3 artist: 

* Mia X, artist with the lowest mean popularity in our data set  
* Beyoncé, artist with nearly the highest mean popularity in our data set
* Mohsen Beats, an artist not in out data set

Using complete pooled model, what would be the approximate posterior predictive mean for a new song from this 3 artists?


```{r}
artist_means <- spotify |> 
  group_by(artist) |> 
  summarize(count = n(), popularity = mean(popularity))

set.seed(84735)
predictions_complete <- posterior_predict(spotify_complete_pooled,
                                          newdata = artist_means)

ppc_intervals(artist_means$popularity, yrep = predictions_complete,
              prob_outer = 0.80) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(labels = artist_means$artist,
                              breaks = 1:nrow(artist_means)) +
  xaxis_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
```


## No pooled model

```{r}
ggplot(spotify, aes(x = popularity, group = artist)) + 
  geom_density()
```

Key points: 

- popularity can differ from one artist to an other

- some artist have a "stable" popularity across their song and some not

Let change our model to reflect that: 

$$Y_{ij}|\mu_j, \sigma \sim N(\mu_{j}, \sigma^2 ) $$
$\mu_{j}$ : mean song popularity for artist $j$

$\sigma$ : standard deviation in popularity from song to song **within each artist**



```{r, results='hide'}
spotify_no_pooled <- stan_glm(
  popularity ~ artist - 1, 
  data = spotify, family = gaussian, 
  prior = normal(50, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735)
```

### Same Quiz but with no pooling!!

3 artist: 

* Mia X, artist with the lowest mean popularity in our data set  
* Beyoncé, artist with nearly the highest mean popularity in our data set
* Mohsen Beats, an artist not in out data set


```{r}
set.seed(84735)
predictions_no <- posterior_predict(
  spotify_no_pooled, newdata = artist_means)
  
# Plot the posterior predictive intervals
ppc_intervals(artist_means$popularity, yrep = predictions_no, 
              prob_outer = 0.80) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(labels = artist_means$artist, 
                              breaks = 1:nrow(artist_means)) +
  xaxis_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
```
Two drawbacks: 

1. Ignoring other artist when modeling for one specific artist (what happens when fewer data point)

2. If we assume no other artists help us understanding popularity of a specific artist we can not generalize to artist outside of our data set.


## Building the hierarchical model 

### The hierarchy

Layer 1:  $Y_{ij} | \mu_j , \sigma_y$ how song popularity varies WITHIN artist $j$

Layer 2: $\mu_{j}|\mu, \sigma_\mu$ how typical popularity $\mu_{j}$ varies BETWEEN artists

Layer 3: $\mu, \sigma_y, \sigma_{\mu}$ prior models for shared global parameters

(order do not necessarily matter)

**Layer 1**: 

$$Y_{ij}|\mu_j, \sigma_j \sim N(\mu_j, \sigma_y^2)$$

$\mu_j$ mean song popularity for artist j

$\sigma_y$ **within group variability** sd in popularity from song to song within each artist

-> if we stop here we have a "no pooled"

**Layer 2**:

$$\mu_{j}|\mu_{j}. \sigma_\mu \overset{ind}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma_\mu^2)$$
$\mu$ global average: the means popularity ratings for the most average artist 

$\sigma_{u}$ $between-group variability$, the standard deviation in mean popularity $μj$
from artist to artist.

```{r}
#Normal is not too bad
ggplot(artist_means, aes(x = popularity)) + 
  geom_density()
```

*Layer 3* : Priors

$$\mu \sim N(50, 52^2)$$
(this 52 ???)

$$\sigma_y \sim Exp(0.048) $$

$$ \sigma  \sim Exp(1)$$ 

![\@realHollanders](images/pc_prior.jpeg)

This is a one way analyis of variance (ANOVA)

An other way to think about it: 

$$Y_{ij}|\mu_j, \sigma_j \sim N(\mu_j, \sigma_y^2) \quad with \quad \mu_j = \mu +b_j$$

$$b_j | \sigma_\mu \overset{ind}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\mu^2) $$

Example: if $\mu$ = 55 and $\mu_j$ = 65 $b_j$ = 10   

### within- vs -between-group variability

Before we analyse just one source of variability (the individual level), now we have two sources ($\sigma_\mu, \sigma_y$). The first one is the sqrt(variance) **within** the group (song of an artist) and the second is the sqrt(variance) **between** group.  

The total variance is : 

$$Var(Y_{ij} = \sigma²_y  + \sigma^2_u) $$
Other way of thinking about is: 

$\frac{\sigma^2_y}{\sigma^2_\mu + \sigma^2_y}$ proportion of total variance explained by difference within each group

$\frac{\sigma^2_\mu}{\sigma^2_\mu + \sigma^2_y}$ proportion of total variance explained by difference between groups

You have correlation in song popularity of the same artist (within group). And assuming each groups are independant we get: 

$$Cor(Y_{ij}, Y_{kj}) =  \frac{\sigma^2_\mu}{\sigma^2_\mu + \sigma^2_y}$$
## Posterior analysis

### Posterior simulation

47 parameters:

- 44 artists specific parameters ($\mu_{j}$)   
- 3 global parameters ($\mu, \sigma_j, sigma_\mu$)


```{r, results='hide'}
spotify_hierarchical <- stan_glmer(
  popularity ~ (1 | artist), # this  is the part that tell that artist is a group not a predictor
  data = spotify, family = gaussian,
  prior_intercept = normal(50, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_covariance = decov(reg = 1, conc = 1, shape = 1, scale = 1), # stuff we will learn chapter 17 suppose to be equivalent to Exp(1)
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735)

```
```{r}
# Confirm the prior tunings
prior_summary(spotify_hierarchical)
```

We need to check the success of MCMC (saving you time here)

```{r}
bayesplot::pp_check(spotify_hierarchical) + xlab("popularity")
```

Let inspect our simulation:

```{r}
spotify_hierarchical_df <- as.data.frame(spotify_hierarchical)
dim(spotify_hierarchical_df)
```

### Posterior analysis of global parameters

* $\mu = (intercept)$  
* $\sigma_y = sigma$  
* $\sigma_\mu² = Sigma[artist:(intercep),(Intercept)]$ Attention! here this is the variance 

```{r}
tidy(spotify_hierarchical, effects = "fixed" # for getting global
     , conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.80)
```

```{r}
tidy(spotify_hierarchical, 
     effects = "ran_pars") # PARameters and RANdomness or variability)
```

An other way: 

```{r}
15.1^2 / (15.1^2 + 14.0^2) # sigma_mu^2 / sigma_mu^2 + sigma_y^2 

14.0^2 / (15.1^2 + 14.0^2) # sigma_y^2 / sigma_mu^2 + sigma_y^2
```
### posterior analysis of group specific 

If you recall that $\mu_j = \mu + b_{j}$ 

We have $\mu$ and $b_j$ (check `spotify_hierarchical_df`)

```{r}
 # RANdom Values
artist_summary <- tidy(spotify_hierarchical, effects = "ran_vals"
                       , conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.80)

# Check out the results for the first & last 2 artists
# 80% intervall
# this produce a summary
artist_summary %>% 
  select(level, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  slice(1:2, 43:44)
```


```{r}
dim(artist_summary)
```


Other way: combining simulations to simulate posterior of $\mu_j$ 

$$\mu_j = \mu + b_{j} = (Intercept) + b[(Intercept) \quad artist:j]$$
```{r}
artist_chains <- spotify_hierarchical |>
  spread_draws(`(Intercept)`, b[,artist]) |> 
  mutate(mu_j = `(Intercept)` + b) 

dim(artist_chains)
```
```{r}
artist_chains |>
  select(artist, `(Intercept)`, b, mu_j) |> 
  head(4)
```

```{r}
# Get posterior summaries for mu_j
artist_summary_scaled <- artist_chains |> 
  select(-`(Intercept)`, -b) |> 
  mean_qi(.width = 0.80) |> 
  mutate(artist = fct_reorder(artist, mu_j))

# Check out the results
artist_summary_scaled |> 
  select(artist, mu_j, .lower, .upper) |>
  head(4)
```

```{r }
ggplot(artist_summary_scaled, 
       aes(x = artist, y = mu_j, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  xaxis_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
```


#### QUiz !

Similar posterior mean but different 80%CI ?

## Posterior prediction

What will be the popularity of new song of artist j (two cases: artist in the data / unknown artist)? 

`posterior_predict()` exist but first we do it by "hand"!

### First case: Frank Ocean (j=39)

$$Y^{i}_{new,j} | \mu_j, \sigma_y \sim N(\mu_j^{i}, (\sigma^{(i)}_y)^2)$$

We have plenty of $\mu^{i}_j$ and $\sigma^{(i)}_y$ with two sources of variability :

- Not all song of Ocean are eqully popular (*within-group sampling variability*)

- we do not know the exact mean and variability of Ocean song (*posterior variability*)

```{r}
# Simulate Ocean's posterior predictive model
set.seed(84735)
ocean_chains <- spotify_hierarchical_df |>
  rename(b = `b[(Intercept) artist:Frank_Ocean]`) |> 
  select(`(Intercept)`, b, sigma) |> 
  mutate(mu_ocean = `(Intercept)` + b,
         y_ocean = rnorm(20000, mean = mu_ocean, sd = sigma)) # stuff that I always forget

# Check it out
head(ocean_chains, 3)
```

Then you summarize it: 

```{r}
ocean_chains |> 
  mean_qi(y_ocean, .width = 0.80) 

# to put into context 
# the range of a new song is wider tham the average of ocean
artist_summary_scaled |>
  filter(artist == "artist:Frank_Ocean")
```

### Posterior prediction for an observed group

We do not have $\mu_j$ but we know new artist is an artist! And we now the range of mean popularity level among artist $N(\mu, \sigma_u)$ and we have 44 artists. 

- step 1: simulate $\mu_{new_artist}$ bt drawing into layer 2 of MCMC

- step 2: simulate song popularity with Layer 1 and $\mu_{new_artist}$

We are adding a new source of variability (not all artist are equally popular : *between group*)

```{r}
set.seed(84735)
mohsen_chains <- spotify_hierarchical_df |>
  mutate(sigma_mu = sqrt(`Sigma[artist:(Intercept),(Intercept)]`),
         mu_mohsen = rnorm(20000, `(Intercept)`, sigma_mu), # new stuff
         y_mohsen = rnorm(20000, mu_mohsen, sigma))

# Posterior predictive summaries
mohsen_chains |> 
  mean_qi(y_mohsen, .width = 0.80)
```

### posterior_predict()

```{r}
set.seed(84735)
prediction_shortcut <- posterior_predict(
  spotify_hierarchical,
  newdata = data.frame(artist = c("Frank Ocean", "Mohsen Beats")))

# Posterior predictive model plots
mcmc_areas(prediction_shortcut, prob = 0.8) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(labels = c("Frank Ocean", "Mohsen Beats"))
```


## Shrinkage & bias_variance trade-off

```{r}
set.seed(84735)
predictions_hierarchical <- posterior_predict(spotify_hierarchical, 
                                              newdata = artist_means)

# Posterior predictive plots
ppc_intervals(artist_means$popularity, yrep = predictions_hierarchical, 
              prob_outer = 0.80) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(labels = artist_means$artist, 
                              breaks = 1:nrow(artist_means)) +
  xaxis_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 58.4, linetype = "dashed")
```

**Quizz** What is shringage in this example ? 

**Shrinkage** refers to the phenomenon in which the group-specific local trends in a hierarchical model are pulled or shrunk toward the global trends.

> Shrinkage increases as the number of observations on group j, nj, decreases. That is, we rely more and more on global trends to understand a group for which we have little data.

> Shrinkage increases when the variability within groups, σy, is large in comparison to the variability between groups, σμ. That is, we rely more and more on global trends to understand a group when there is little distinction in the patterns from one group to the next

> The artists that shrunk the most are those with smaller sample sizes nj and popularity levels at the extremes of the spectrum.

### Quizzz!

With no pooled, complete pooled and hierarchical: 

1. Same population, other sample: which would be the most/least variable?

2. Most biased/least estinating artist mean popularity levels? 

## Not everything is hierarchical 

Distinction between a *predictor* and a *grouping variable* can only be made if we understand how data was collected. 

## Summary 

First model with groups!

* observations on one group are independent to another group but correlated in the same group

* New parameters : group-specific 

* global parameters 

* learning for one group to another will lead to some shrinkage 

* this models are less variable than no pooling and less biased than complete pooling
