# Adding More Layers




`r knitr::include_graphics("images/Theend.jpg")`


**Learning objectives:**

- So far we have used individual-level predictors... how can we also utilize *group-level* predictors?

- What happens with more then one grouping variable?

```{r,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(bayesrules)
library(tidyverse)
library(bayesplot)
library(rstanarm)
library(janitor)
library(tidybayes)
library(broom.mixed)
library(gridExtra)
```

## Group-level predictors - Airbnb Data Revisited

- Return to Airbnb data, this time look at (log) price.

```{r}
data(airbnb)
airbnb %>% 
  summarize(nlevels(neighborhood), min(price), max(price))
```


- Prices *look* lognormal:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(airbnb) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping= aes(x=log(price)),color = "white", binwidth = 0.5)
```

## Airbnb : Individual-level predictors

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(airbnb, aes(y = log(price), x = bedrooms)) + 
  geom_jitter()
p2<-ggplot(airbnb, aes(y = log(price), x = rating)) + 
  geom_jitter()
p3<-ggplot(airbnb, aes(y = log(price), x = room_type)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,ncol=3)
```

## Air-bnb Hierachical structure

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(airbnb, aes(y = log(price), x = neighborhood)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(1:44))
```

- Wide variation of variation of median price -> use neighborhood as grouping variable to account for this.

## Air-bnb Group Level predictors

- The data also contains group level predictors: walk_score and transit score

- These are the same for each property in a given neighborhood.

```{r}
airbnb %>% 
  select(price, neighborhood, walk_score, transit_score) %>% 
  head(3)
```
- We can use `walk_score` to  'explain' some of the variation from neighborhood to neighborhood.

```{r}

nbhd_features <- airbnb %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood, walk_score) %>% 
  summarize(mean_log_price = mean(log(price)), n_listings = n(),.groups="drop")  


ggplot(nbhd_features, aes(y = mean_log_price, x = walk_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Incorporating group predictors

- Model ends up looking complicated 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/eqn19_4.png")`

- But including it is relatively easy!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airbnb_model_2 <- stan_glmer(
  log(price) ~ walk_score + bedrooms + rating + room_type +
    (1 | neighborhood), 
  data = airbnb, family = gaussian,
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735
)
```




## Airbnb median model 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tidy(airbnb_model_2, effects="fixed")
```

```
  term                  estimate std.error
  <chr>                    <dbl>     <dbl>
1 (Intercept)             1.92     0.305  
2 walk_score              0.0166   0.00342
3 bedrooms                0.265    0.0139 
4 rating                  0.221    0.0282 
5 room_typePrivate room  -0.538    0.0224 
6 room_typeShared room   -1.06     0.0583 
```

This leads to a median model:

$$
median(log(\text{price})) = (1.9 + 0.017 \text{ walk_score}) + 0.27 \text{ bedrooms} + \\
0.22\text{ rating} - 0.54 \text{ private_room} - 1.1 \text{ shared_room}
$$

- For  example, the median log price increases by about 17% for every 10 points increase in walkability.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
tidy(airbnb_model_2, effects = "ran_pars")
```
```
  term                        group        estimate
  <chr>                       <chr>           <dbl>
1 sd_(Intercept).neighborhood neighborhood    0.202
2 sd_Observation.Residual     Residual        0.366
```
- These are estimates of the group level variation and within group variation

- Book notes that the 'unexplained' neighborhood to neighborhood variation is less now that we have included the group-level predictor (makes sense!)



## Airbnb posterior group-level analysis

- This section looks at neighborhood-level trends, focusing on two neighborhoods with mean log price but vastly different walk ability

```{r, echo=FALSE}

nbhd_features %>% 
  filter(neighborhood %in% c("Edgewater", "Pullman"))

```

- Compare the group-level intercepts for models with (closed circle) and without (open circle) the `walk_score` group level indicator:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/fig19_6.png")`

- The model with the `walk_score` predictor has pulled Pullman’s intercept ($\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 U_j$) down, closer to the trend

- Note the small sample size for Pullman. Using group level predictors helps us to pool information across groups, improving understanding of small sample size groups.



## Two or more grouping variables

- Remember last chapter we used `climbers` to model success of a climber, grouped by expedition. 

- However there is also peak_name as a possible grouping variable!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(climbers_sub)
climbers <- climbers_sub %>% 
  select(peak_name, expedition_id, member_id, success,
         year, season, age, expedition_role, oxygen_used)
```

```{r}
expeditions <- climbers %>% 
  group_by(peak_name, expedition_id) %>% 
  summarize(n_climbers = n(),.groups="drop")

head(expeditions,4)
```
- Dataset includes 2076 individual climbers, grouped together in 200 expeditions, to 46 different peaks

## Hiearchical model 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/fig19_7.png")`

- Just as different expeditions have related climber success probabilities, we expect the same for different peaks. 
- We don't really care about the particular subset of peaks in the data, but we want to incorporate it -> Grouping variable.  

- Now we have two 'tweaks',  $b_{0j}$ adjustment for expedition `j` and $p_{0k}$, adjustment for  peak `k`.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/fig19_8.png")`

- $Y_{ijk}$ is the success of the i'th climber, who climbed the j'th peak in the k'th expedition. (nested structure of the data)

- $\sigma_b$ is the variability of success rates from expedition to expedition (within a peak)

- $\sigma_p$ is the variability between peaks.

## Simulating the model

- Model 1, doesn't include the peak id, as in Chapter 18

```{r, eval=FALSE}
climb_model_1 <- stan_glmer(
  success ~ age + oxygen_used + (1 | expedition_id), 
  data = climbers, family = binomial, 
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735
)
```


- Model 2, including the peak id is easy to specify!

```{r, eval= FALSE}
climb_model_2 <- stan_glmer(
  success ~ age + oxygen_used + (1 | expedition_id) + (1 | peak_name), 
  data = climbers, family = binomial, 
  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 84735
)
```

```{r, eval= FALSE}
saveRDS(climb_model_2,"data/climb_model_2.Rds")
```

```{r}
climb_model_2 <- readRDS("data/climb_model_2.Rds")
```


- If this were real work we would check the priors and chain health etc...

## Posterior summaries

- The two models lead to similar conclusions for the relationship with age and oxygen use.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Get trend summaries for both models
climb_model_1_mean <- tidy(climb_model_1, effects = "fixed")
climb_model_2_mean <- tidy(climb_model_2, effects = "fixed")

# Combine the summaries for both models
climb_model_1_mean %>%
  right_join(., climb_model_2_mean, by ="term",
             suffix = c("_model_1", "_model_2")) %>%
  select(-starts_with("std.error"))
```

```
  term            estimate_model_1 estimate_model_2
  <chr>                      <dbl>            <dbl>
1 (Intercept)              -1.41            -1.53  
2 age                      -0.0475          -0.0474
3 oxygen_usedTRUE           5.79             6.18  

```

- Different accounting of the variability in success rates.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
climb_model_1_var <- tidy(climb_model_1, effects = "ran_pars")
climb_model_2_var <- tidy(climb_model_2, effects = "ran_pars")

# Combine the summaries for both models
climb_model_1_var %>% 
  right_join(., climb_model_2_var, by = "term",
             suffix =c("_model_1", "_model_2")) %>%
  select(-starts_with("group"))
```

```
  term                         estimate_model_1 estimate_model_2
  <chr>                                   <dbl>            <dbl>
1 sd_(Intercept).expedition_id             3.63             3.09
2 sd_(Intercept).peak_name                NA                1.85
```

- This makes sense, not only are some expeditions more successeful , some peaks are easier to climb.

## Group specific parameters

- Climb model 2:

$$
log(\frac{\pi_{ijk}}{1-\pi_{ijk}})=(\beta_0 + b_{0j} + p_{0k}) + \beta_1 X_{ijk1} + \beta_2 X_{ijk2}
$$

- For each of the 200 sampled expeditions and 46 sampled peaks, we have associated posterior distributions for the $b_{0j}$ and $p_{0k}$   

```{r}
group_levels_2 <- tidy(climb_model_2, effects = "ran_vals") %>% 
  select(level, group, estimate)
```



- Example tweaks for peaks: 

```{r}
group_levels_2 %>% 
  filter(group == "peak_name") %>% 
  head(2)
```

 

- Example tweaks for expedition:

```{r}
group_levels_2 %>% 
  filter(group == "expedition_id") %>% 
  head(2)
```
 

- For example, to predict success probability for a climber new expedition to an existing peak (say Ama_Dablam, an 'easy one'), we would would use $b=0$ and the appropriate $p_{0j}=2.91$.  If the climber were 30 years old but did not plan  to use oxygen:

```{r}
logit_p = -1.53 +  2.91 - .0474*30 

invlogit(logit_p)
```

49% chance of success. Could also use `posterior_prediction`

```{r}
new_expedition <- data.frame(
  age = c(30), oxygen_used = c(FALSE), 
  expedition_id = c("new"), peak_name = c("Ama_Dablam") )

binary_prediction <- posterior_predict(climb_model_2, newdata = new_expedition)

mean(binary_prediction)

```
 
 If they did use oxygen:
 
```{r}
logit_p = -1.53 +  2.91 - .0474*30  + 6.2

invlogit(logit_p)
``` 

With prediction:



```{r}
new_expedition <- data.frame(
  age = c(30), oxygen_used = c(TRUE), 
  expedition_id = c("new"), peak_name = c("Ama_Dablam") )

binary_prediction <- posterior_predict(climb_model_2, newdata = new_expedition)

mean(binary_prediction)
```

Why different?  `invlogit` is nonlinear (but monotonic)

## Check prediction manually

```{r}
climber_df <- as.data.frame(climb_model_2)
climber_draws_Ama_Dablam <- climber_df |>
     select('(Intercept)',age, oxygen_usedTRUE,
            'b[(Intercept) peak_name:Ama_Dablam]','Sigma[expedition_id:(Intercept),(Intercept)]') |>
     rename(b_peak ='b[(Intercept) peak_name:Ama_Dablam]', sigma_exp = 'Sigma[expedition_id:(Intercept),(Intercept)]',
            B_0 = '(Intercept)')

head(climber_draws_Ama_Dablam)
```

Ok for each of these 20000 draws, we need to compute a random expedition tweak with the appropriate sigma, and then compute the probability from the inverse logistic.

```{r}
logit_draws <- climber_draws_Ama_Dablam |>
  mutate(exp_tweak = rnorm(n(),0, sqrt(sigma_exp))) |>
  mutate(without_tweak = B_0 + 30*age + oxygen_usedTRUE + b_peak,
         with_tweak =  without_tweak + exp_tweak)
 
draws_longer <- logit_draws |> pivot_longer(cols = c('without_tweak', 'with_tweak'), names_to = "tweak", values_to = "logit")

draws_longer <- draws_longer |> mutate(prob_success = invlogit(logit))

ggplot(data = draws_longer) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=logit, color=tweak))
```

Summary statistics: 
 
```{r}
draws_longer |> group_by(tweak) |> 
  summarize(mean=mean(prob_success),
           median=median(prob_success),
           q_lower = quantile(prob_success,.1),
           q_higher = quantile(prob_success,.9),.groups = "drop")
```
 
 The expedition random tweak only effects the mean, the median is invariant for monotonic function like `invlogit`.  But the mean is what you get if you simulate  the Bernoulli event for each probability draw in the same way `posterior_predict` does.

$$
p_{succ} = \mathbb{E}(Y) \approx \frac{1}{N_{draws}} \sum_{draws} \pi_{draw} = \mathbb{E}(\pi)
$$

Or one could report the full posterior for $\pi$ :

```{r}
ggplot(data = draws_longer |> filter(tweak=='with_tweak')) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=prob_success )) + xlim(.95,1) 
```
