# Preface {-}

## Bayesian statistics?

* Frequentist and Bayesian methods share: *learning from data* 

But Bayesian allows: 

- new data + prior  
- results easier to interpret
- shines when frequentist fails 
- computational tools more accesible now

## Tips and tricks from the authors

- Learn by doing  
- Embrace a growth mindset (we will do mistakes!) 
- Interpret Bayes in a context (ethics and maybe more)
- Practice, practice, practice


## Set up

Install **rstan** : https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("bayesrules", "tidyverse", "janitor", "rstanarm",
                   "bayesplot", "tidybayes", "broom.mixed", "modelr",
                   "e1071", "forcats"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

On linux (ubuntu 22) I had to update some dependencies.
